This release comes with a full rewrite of the Sentry Gradle Plugin.

Here is the [Migration Guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-android-gradle-plugin-1x-to-iosentrysentry-android-gradle-plugin-200).

Improvements:

* Using lazily Providers
* Support for Configuration Avoidance
* Only try to upload mapping file if `minifyEnabled` is enabled
* Plugin Marker is published, so you may use the `plugins` block
* Rewritten in Kotlin
* Unit and Integration tests
* CI Matrix that runs against different AGP/Gradle/Java and OS versions

Breaking changes:

* Sentry Android Gradle Plugin requires Android Gradle Plugin >= 4.0.0
